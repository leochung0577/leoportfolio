                <p>I studied for 8 years at Marlborough from Elementary all the way to grade 7.
                    My experience at Marlborough was great, the school was really big with a lot 
                    of students. Often times you would never find yourself in a room without people.</p>

               <p>I studied at South from grade 8 to grade 12. My frist experience going from 
                  elementary school to high school, I thought it was really big and it was a really 
                  big step up from Elementary school. It was also really scared at first, but 
                  when I meet some new friends I realized that were exactly the same as me </p>

                <p>I studied at Moscrop only 2 years every summer. It was big but most places where 
                restrictive also I got to reunite with old elementary school friends.</p>
